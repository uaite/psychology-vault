A complex set of highly interconnected brain regions that are dedicated to emotion. Contrasting to the cortex, which processes external information, the limbic system processes internal information, such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, perspiration, and emotions. It can be thought of as the brain's emotional center, but it also plays roles in smell, motivation, and memory, all of which help shaping emotions.

The limbic system evolved out the olfactory system, which controlled various survival behaviors in mammals. See how smells evoke powerful memories in humans: many patients with PTSD experience reactivation upon being exposed to certain smells.

## Thalamus

A sensory relay station. Most sensory information first passes through it for initial processing. It contains many areas, each connected to a specific region of the cerebral cortex.
## Hypothalamus

Responsible for regulating and maintaining constant internal bodily states. Different areas of the hypothalamus play roles in emotion and motivation, with some involved with key psychological drives, like hunger, thirst, sexual motivation, or other emotional behaviors. The "four Fs": feeding, fighting, fleeing, and fucking. It also helps control body temperature, acting like a thermostat.

Means "below the thalamus", and it's located on the floor of the brain. 

The [[Pituitary gland]] is part of the hypothalamus as is controlled by it.

## Amygdala

Responsible for excitement, arousal, and especially fear. Also plays a key role in fear conditioning, a process where animals learn to predict when something scary is about to happen. The amygdala can produce an emotional response before the rest of your brain is aware of it.

Shaped an almond (amygdala is derived from the Greek word for almond).

See the [[S.M.]] case.

## Hippocampus

Plays crucial roles in memory, especially spatial memory (physical layouts). When we make a mental map for getting from A to B, we're in part using the hippocampus. 

A portion of the hippocampus is larger in London taxi drivers than in non-taxi drivers and is especially large in experienced taxi drivers (Maguire et al., 2000). This correlation could mean either that people with experience navigating complex environments develop large hippocampi, or that people with larger hippocampi seek out occupations relying on spatial navigation, or both. There's research suggesting the hippocampus can increase in size following learning (Boyke et al., 2008).

Damage to the hippocampus causes problems forming new memories, but old memories are intact. One hypothesis is that the hippocampus houses memories temporarily, then transfers them to other sites for permanent storage (Sanchez-Andres, Old, & Alkon, 1993). There's a rival theory, the multiple trace theory, which points to memories being initially stores at multiple sites, and this storage becomes stronger at some sites and weaker at others. This implies memories aren't transferred from the hippocampus to the cortex, but that memories are already in the cortex and merely become stronger over time.
