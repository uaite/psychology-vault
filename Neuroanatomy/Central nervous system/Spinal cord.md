Conveys information between the brain and the rest of the body. Extends from the [[Brain stem|brain stem]] and runs down the middle of the back. 

**Nerves** extend from neurons to the body, traveling in two directions. Sensory information is carried from the body to the brain by way of **sensory nerves**, while motor commands are carried from the brain to the body through **motor nerves**.

The spinal cord also contains sensory neurons that contact **interneurons**.

## Interneurons

Neurons that send messages to other neurons nearby. They connect sensory nerves with motor nerves within the spinal cord, without having to report back to the brain.

Explain how reflexes, which are automatic motor responses to sensory stimuli, can occur.
