When a cognitive function relies more on one side of the brain than the other.

It's important to bear in mind this isn't extreme. It's even possible to live with half of a brain, even though patients from **split-brain surgery** (a procedure falling out of practice where the corpus callosum is severed to treat epilepsy) often experience strange disconnects between information from each side, since the brain can no longer communicate well between the two hemispheres. A person with an entire hemisphere removed has a better chance if the surgery is performed during childhood, as the leftover hemisphere has time to learn and adapt.
