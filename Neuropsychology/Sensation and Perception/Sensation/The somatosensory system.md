The system for touch, position, and balance. **Proprioception** is the name of the body position sense, and **vestibular sense** is the sense of equilibrium and balance.

The somatosensory system is activated by various types of stimuli, like soft or deep pressure, hot or cold temperatures, and painful chemical or mechanical injuries. There's also referred pain, which is internal pain felt in a different location, i.e. the aching arm during a heart attack.

## Nerve endings

Light touch, deep pressure, and temperature is sensed through specialized nerve endings located on the ends of sensory nerves in the skin.

There are also **free nerve endings** for feeling touch, temperature, and especially pain. They are much more plentiful than specialized nerve endings.

Nerve endings are unevenly distributed across the body. For example, the tip of the fingertips has many more nerve endings than other parts of the body, which is why paper cuts sting, but a strong back massage doesn't hurt.

## Perception

Somatosensory stimuli travel through somatic nerves, than the spinal cord. Touch travels faster than pain. Often touch and pain trigger reflex locally at the spine.

After triggering spinal reflexes, touch and pain information travels upward to the brain stem and thalamus to reach the somatosensory cortex (Bushnell et al., 1999). Other cortical areas are active during the localization of touch information, like association areas of the parietal lobe.

## Pain

There are many varieties of pain: sharp, stabbing, throbbing, burning, and aching. The perception relates to the type of stimulus. It can also be acute or chronic.

Pain stimulus has a **threshold** where it's perceived as painful.

Pain can't be localized as precisely as touch. It also has a large emotional component, since pain information goes partly to the limbic system, which explains why it's frequently associated with anxiety.

### Gate control model

According to the **gate control model** (Melzack and Wall, 1965 and 1970), pain can be controlled by thoughts and emotions. For example, during childbirth or combat, neural mechanisms of pain are blocked and the spinal cord functions as a "gate". This can account for how pain varies depending on the psychological state.

Pain can be reduced by removing attention from it, or increased by dwelling on it. Falk Eippert and his colleagues (Eippert et al., 2009) used brain imaging to demonstrate that pain-related activity in the spinal cord is sharply reduced when participants receive an application of a placebo cream they’re told would alleviate pain. This can also be related to the production of endorphins.

### Phantom limb illusion

Persons with amputated limbs can experience phantom pain, which is pain or discomfort in the missing limb. About 90% of amputees experience it.

There's a treatment called the **mirror box** which uses a mirror to simulate the position of the missing limb, allowing people to relieve the pain by "repositioning the phantom limb".

### Pain insensitivity

Pain is an essential function, so pain disorders are very dangerous. Pain insensitivity from birth is extremely rare. Lacking any pain awareness, children may chew off parts of their bodies, or break bones and not realize it.

## Proprioception and vestibular sense

Proprioception, or the kinesthetic sense, helps keeping track of spatial positioning and moving efficiently. 

The vestibular sense, or the sense of equilibrium, enables sensing and maintaining balance.

This is how humans can keep their bodies upright and in control without actively thinking about it.

## Proprioceptors

There are two kinds of proprioceptors: **stretch receptors** and **force detectors**, embedded in the muscles and in the tendons respectively. Proprioceptive information enters the spinal cord, travels upward through the brain stem and thalamus, and reaches the somatosensory and motor cortexes (Naito, 2004).

## Vestibular information

The inner ear contains the cochlea and three semicircular canals filled with fluid for keeping balance.

This information reaches parts of the brain stem that control eye muscles and trigger reflexes for coordinating head and eye movements. It also travels to the cerebellum for catching balance when falling.

This sense isn't very present in the cerebral cortex, so the awareness of it is limited. It can become more apparent when losing balance or when the vestibular and visual inputs mismatch, like experiencing motion sickness when reading inside a moving car.
