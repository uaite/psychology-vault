Sound is vibration, mechanical energy traveling through a medium. Sound waves can travel through any gas, liquid, or solid, but they can be heard best when traveling through air. In vacuum, there can't be sound because there aren't any airborne molecules to vibrate.

## Sound characteristics

**Pitch** is the frequency of the wave, measured in hertz (Hz). Higher frequency means high pitch, lower frequency means lower pitch. The human ear can pick up from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Younger people are more sensitive to higher pitch tones than adults.

**Loudness** is the amplitude of the wave, measured in decibels (dB). More amplitude means louder, since there's more mechanical disturbance. 

**Timbre** is the quality or complexity of the sound.

## The ear

In the ear, sense receptors for hearing [[Transduction|transduce]] sound into neural activity.

The outer ear, consisting of the pinna and the ear canal, funnels sound waves onto the eardrum.

In the inner ear, the spiral-shaped **cochlea** converts vibration into neural activity. The outer part is bony, but the inner cavity is filled with a thick fluid, through which sound waves travel and reach the base of the cochlea, where the pressure is released and transduction happens. The **organ of Corti** and **basilar membrane** contain hair cells that are responsible for transduction, converting acoustic information into action potentials. The information feeds into the auditory nerve, which travels to the brain through the [[Limbic system#Thalamus|thalamus]]. 

Once the **auditory nerve** enters the brain, it reaches the brain stem, which sends auditory information higher up to the auditory cortex. Each stage increases in complexity.

### Perceiving pitch 

In the primary auditory cortex, different tones are processed in different places. Hair cells at the base of the basilar membrane are most excited by high-pitched tones, whereas the ones at the top are sensitive to low-pitched tones. This model of pitch perception is called **place theory** because a specific place along the basilar membrane matches a tone with a specific pitch. This theory only accounts for the perception of high-pitched tones, from 5,000 to 20,000 Hz.

For low-pitched tones, there are two theories. The first and simplest, **frequency theory**, says the rate at which neurons fire action potentials reproduces the pitch. This works well up to 100 Hz due to neuron firing rates. **Volley theory** is a variation that explains tones between 100 and 5,000 Hz using sets of neurons firing at their highest rate slightly out of sync.

## Deafness

There are several causes of deafness, like genetic, disease, injury, or exposure to loud noise. The nature of deafness can be conductive, as in a malfunctioning of the ear, especially a failure of the eardrum or the ossicles; or nervous, due to damage to the auditory nerve.

Loud sounds can cause noise-induced hearing loss, which is usually accompanied by tinnitus. It can also happen due to aging and the degeneration of the auditory nerve.
