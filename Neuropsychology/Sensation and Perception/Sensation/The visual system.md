Building an image involves light, biological systems in the eye and brain for image processing, and our past experiences.

Light is electromagnetic energy. Visible light has a wavelength measured in nanometers, and we respond to the range of 400 (purple) to 700 (red) nm of wavelengths.

When light reaches an object, part of the light gets reflected by the object, and part gets absorbed. Our perception of **brightness** is influenced directly by the intensity of the reflected light. The brightness of an object depends also on the overall lighting surrounding the object.

**Hue** is the color of the light. Mixing red, green, and blue additively can make any color. The same is true for mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow subtractively.

## The eyes

Various parts of the eye allow different amounts of light in, in turn allowing us to see. 

### The sclera, iris, and pupil

The white of the eye, the colored part of the eye, and the hole inside the iris, respectively.

The iris works like the shutter of a camera, controlling how much light enters the eye.

The pupil is how light gets in. The closing of the pupil is a reflex response to light or objects approaching. This reflex happens simultaneously in both eyes, even if only one gets more light.

Dilation of the pupil also has psychological significance, since it happens when processing complex information, or viewing someone we find physically attractive.

### The cornea, lens, and eye muscles

#accommodation

The cornea is a curved, transparent layer covering the iris and the pupil. It bends light, focusing it at the back of the eye. 

The lens is a completely transparent cell, which allows light to shine through it. It also bends light, and it can change its curvature for fine-tuning. Through **accommodation**, the lenses change shape to focus light on the back of the eye, adapting to different perceived distances of objects. When flat, it enables us to see distant objects; when fat, it allows focusing on nearby objects.

### The shape of the eye

How much the eye needs to bend light depends on the curve of the cornea and overall shape of the eye. Problems in the shape can result in *myopia* or *hyperopia* since it alters the focal point of light.

### The retina

A thin membrane at the back of the eye where the light is projected. The central part of the retina is called the **fovea**, and it's responsible for sharpness. It contains millions of sense receptor cells for vision. Scholars say it's technically part of the brain.

There are two types of receptor cells in the retina: **rods** and **cones**. There are far more rods than cones.

#### Rods
Long and narrow cells which enable seeing basic shapes and forms. Enable seeing in low light. When entering a dimly lit room, **dark adaptation** occurs, which takes about 30 minutes, the time it takes for rods to regain their maximum sensitivity to light. Since there are no rods in the fovea, tilting the head allows more light to fall on rods through peripheral vision.

#### Cones
Cone-shaped cells for color vision. They are sensitive to detail, but require more light than rods.

Different types of receptor cells contain **photopigments**, chemicals that change color when exposed to light. 

### The optic nerve
The bundle of [[Axon|axons]] of the ganglion cells in the retinal circuit which reach the brain from the eye.

It goes from the retina to the rest of the brain. After the optic nerves leave both eyes, they fork, forming the **optic chiasm**. Half of the axons cross in the optic chiasm. Right after, the optic nerves enter the brain, becoming the **optic tracts**. The optic tracts send most of their axons to the visual part of the thalamus, then to the primary visual cortex (V1), which is the primary route for visual perceptions. The rest of the axons go to the midbrain, particularly the **superior colliculus**, and they play a key role in reflexes.

There's a blind spot where the optic nerve connects to the retina, since there are no rods or sense receptors. The ganglion cells push everything else aside.

## How we perceive

Many cells in V1 respond to slits of light in a specific orientation. **Simple cells** in the visual cortex display a yes-no response to slits in a specific orientation and location. **Complex cells** are also orientation specific, but less restricted to location.

**Feature detection** is the ability to use minimal patterns to identify objects. Simple and complex cells can be called feature detector cells, as they detect lines and edges. There are even more complex feature detector cells at later levels of visual processing when reaching V2. Numerous researchers have proposed a model of visual processing which higher cortical regions process more and more complex shapes. 

#### Color perception
There are two main theories: **trichromatic** and **opponent process**. They stem from the fact there are three types of [[#Cones]] in the eye.

**Trichromatic theory** is the idea that color vision is based on sensitivity to the three primary colors: red, green, and blue.

**Opponent process theory** says we perceive colors in three pairs of opposing colors: either red or green, blue or yellow, or black or white. It tries to explain something the previous theory failed, which is afterimages - when we stare at one color for a long time and look away, and the afterimage appears to be in another color.

In actuality, both theories are correct, and they are complementary. The trichromatic theory refers to the cones, and opponent process, to the ganglion cells.

## Deficiencies

**Visual agnosia** is a deficit in perceiving objects. A person might be able to tell the shape and color of an object, but can't recognize or name it.
