These two systems are interconnected and work together in our liking or disliking of foods, for example. 

Humans aren't particularly sensitive to smell when compared to other animals, but sensing the smell and taste of food is critical for survival and knowing what foods are safe to consume.

As for taste, there are five basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. There's preliminary evidence for the fatty and starchy tastes.

## The sensors

There are more than 1000 olfactory genes. Each olfactory neuron contains a single type of receptor for recognizing an odorant based on its shape. When olfactory receptors come into contact with odor molecules, action potentials in olfactory neurons are triggered.

Taste is detected through taste buds in the tongue's papillae. There are separate taste buds for each type of taste, but the "taste map" of the tongue is a myth. There are taste buds for every type spread throughout the tongue.

## Perception

There are important genetic differences in how people perceive taste. Supertasters are overrepresented among women and people of African and Asian descent, which can explain why they avoid bitter tastes in alcohol and tobacco.

## Emotion

Taste, but especially smell, is extremely connected to emotion since it's processed in the [[Limbic system]] besides the olfactory cortex, gustatory cortex, and somatosensory cortex. The amygdala helps in distinguishing pleasant from disgusting smells. 

Emotional disorders, like anxiety and depression, can distort taste perception. Neurotransmitters like [[serotonin]] and [[Norepinephrine (noradrenaline)|norepinephrine]] increase taste sensitivity. Tom Heath and his colleagues (2006) found that antidepressant drugs rendered participants more sensitive to various combinations of sweet, sour, and bitter tastes. Their research may shed light on appetite loss, which is a frequent symptom of depression.

Smell is especially important in sexual behavior. Mammals that respond to **pheromones** use the **vomeronasal organ** to detect it. Since this organ doesn't exist in humans, we may be insensitive to pheromones. However, the human pheromone has been discovered (Pearson, 2006), and may be detected by the "nerve zero" (Fields, 2007). Smells other than pheromones may contribute to human sexual behavior.
