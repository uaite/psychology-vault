Humans use various brain centers to locate sounds respective to their bodies. This is enabled by how the auditory nerve connects with both sides of the brain after passing through the brain stem. Since information from both ears reaches both sides but take different routes, they arrive slightly out of sync, and the brain uses this **binaural cue** to localize sound sources. There's also a loudness difference. 

We can also rely on **monaural cues**, that is, by one ear. This helps in distinguishing clear versus muffled sounds.
