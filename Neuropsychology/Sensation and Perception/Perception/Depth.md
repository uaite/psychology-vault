**Depth perception** is the ability to see spatial relations in three dimensions.

We need to know how close or far we are from objects to navigate around the environment. There are two main cues: **monocular depth cues** and **binocular depth cues**.

Depth perception begins in infancy and is developed with experience.
## Monocular cues

Perceiving three dimensions using only one eye. This relies on **pictorial cues**:

- **Relative size:** distant objects look smaller
- **Texture gradient:** texture becomes less apparent as distance increases
- **Interposition:** closer objects block farther objects
- **Linear perspective:** outlines converge as distance increases. Most lines in a scene can be traced to the **vanishing point**
- **Height in plane:** distant objects tend to appear higher
- **Light and shadow:** objects cast shadows that provide a sense of their form

The last cue isn't pictorial, and it's the ability to judge the distance of moving objects from their speed: **motion parallax**. It describes how nearby objects seem to move faster than those far away traveling at the same speed. It also works backward: nearby objects pass quicker when we are moving.

## Binocular cues

Visual information from both sides of the optic nerve is sent to neighboring cells in the visual cortex. This is used to make comparisons, forming the basis of binocular depth perception.

**Binocular disparity** describes how the eyes send different information for near objects, but not far ones. Since each eye sees the world differently, the brain uses this to perceive depth.

**Binocular convergence** describes how the brain is aware of how much the eyes are converging to look at nearby objects, using this information to judge depth.
