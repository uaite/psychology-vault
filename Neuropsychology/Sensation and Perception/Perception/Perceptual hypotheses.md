Usually, the brain makes an "educated guess" about what the sensory information means. This is more efficient and important for saving energy and neuron usage.

## Perceptual sets

A set formed when expectations influence perceptions (see [[Parallel processing|top-down processing]]). 

Humans tend to perceive the world according to their individual perceptions.

## Perceptual constancy

The process by which humans perceive stimuli consistently when conditions vary. Without this, humans would be continually confused.

There are shape, size, and color constancies. 

**Shape constancy** allows understanding an object as the same even if its shape changes due to perspective. A door is still a door no matter how open or closed it is.

**Size constancy** allows perceiving an object as the same size no matter the distance. We don't believe someone is shrinking when they are going further away.

**Color constancy** allows understanding color consistently across varying lighting situations. That's because color is evaluated based on the surrounding context and background light.
