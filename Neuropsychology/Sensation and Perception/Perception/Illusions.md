Illusions are great ways to understand how the system works by viewing how it "breaks".

## Moon illusion

The illusions that the moon appears larger when it's near the horizon than high in the sky.

The most accepted explanation is errors in perceived distance - when it's high up, there's nothing to compare it to.

## Ames room illusion

A trapezoidal room where the walls are slanted, and the ceiling and floor are at an incline. By putting two people of the same size at the right spots, and observing them also from the right spot, the room creates the illusions that one person shrinks dramatically.

This happens due to the relative size principle. The distortions in the room make it look normal, which distorts the people in it.

## Müller-Lyer illusion

Since we perceive lines as part of a larger context, these lines of identical length appear different due to the direction that the arrowheads are pointing.

## Ponzo illusion

Also called the railroad tracks illusion. The converging lines encase two objects of identical size, which makes us perceive the closer one as larger.

## Horizontal-vertical illusion

We perceive the vertical line as longer because the horizontal one is "divided in half".

## Ebbinghaus-Titchener illusion

We perceive a circle as larger when surrounded by smaller circles, and smaller when surrounded by bigger circles.
