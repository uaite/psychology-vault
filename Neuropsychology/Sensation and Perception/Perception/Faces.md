Face recognition is vital for navigating society. Humans don't need an exact picture of a face to recognize it - think of caricature, which exaggerates features, but are still recognizable.

The ability to view faces holistically instead of as a sum of its parts is crucial. 

There is a region of the temporal lobe called the **fusiform gyrus** which plays a central role in recognizing faces. When it's damaged, it can result in [[#Prosopagnosia]].

Researchers have identified neurons in the hippocampus that fire selectively in response to specific faces.  In the 1960s, Jerry Lettvin half-jokingly proposed that each neuron might store a single memory, like the recollection of our grandmother sitting in our living room when we were children. He coined the term “grandmother cell” to describe this argument, assuming it could be easily falsified (Horgan, 2005).

We can only observe a small number of neurons at once, so it's impossible to know what the brain is doing as a whole. The best hypothesis is that networks of neurons work in face recognition.
## Prosopagnosia

Face blindness. An extremely rare condition.

Prosopagnostics depend on nonfacial cues, like freckles, weight, glasses, and clothes, to recognize people. In some cases, they can't recognize even their parents or partners.

This condition can be present at birth, but it's more commonly a result of brain trauma or a neurological disease.
