The brain often provides missing information about outlines. This is called **subjective contours**.

**Gestalt principles** are the rules that explain how humans perceive objects as wholes within their context (*Gestalt* means whole in German). They help explain how we perceive the world as unified figures.

## Proximity

Objects physically close to each other tend to be perceived as unified wholes.

## Similarity

Similar objects are more often seen as a whole.

## Continuity

Objects are still perceived as whole even if other objects block parts of them.

## Closure

Objects are "filled-in" when they are partly missing. See the Kanizsa figure above.

## Symmetry

Objects are perceived as a whole more often when they are symmetrically arranged.

## Figure-ground

When focused on a perceived central figure, humans tend to ignore what's perceived as the background. Some figures, called **bistable**, can be viewed in two ways (see below).

Another important concept related to bistable images is **emergence**, defined as when a gestalt is suddenly perceived.
