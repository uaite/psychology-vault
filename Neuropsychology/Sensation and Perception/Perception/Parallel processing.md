Attending to many sense modalities at once.

In **bottom-up processing**, the brain constructs a whole stimulus from its parts, like perceiving an object based on its edges. It starts with raw stimuli and ends with synthesizing them into a concept, by the primary visual cortex, then the association cortex.

In  **top-down processing**, processing starts with beliefs and expectations, which are imposed on the raw stimuli. This begins in the association cortex, then the primary visual cortex.

Some people rely more on one kind of processing. Most cases don't rely on any specifically.
