Perception of events outside the known channels of sensation. This is, of course, not possible and is a pseudoscience performed by parapsychologists.

There are three major types:

1. Precognition: acquiring knowledge of future events
2. Telepathy: reading minds
3. Clairvoyance: detecting presences hidden from view

People may believe in ESP due to **illusory correlations**. People tend to attend to and recall events that are striking coincidences or forget events that aren't. This results in a perceived statistical association when there isn't one.

Reading techniques rely on **cold reading**, the art of persuading someone you've just met. It works because humans seek meaning everywhere, so cold readers use generic statements that people assign meaning to.
