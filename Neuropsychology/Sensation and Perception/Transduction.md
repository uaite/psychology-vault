The process by which the nervous system converts external stimuli into electrical signs within neurons. This is performed by specific types of **sense receptors**, which are specialized cells for transducing specific stimuli.

The activation of the nervous system is greatest when a stimulus is first detected. Through **sensory adaptation**, the response weakens over time. This adaptation happens at the level of the sense receptor - so the receptor itself reacts strongly at first, then declines.
