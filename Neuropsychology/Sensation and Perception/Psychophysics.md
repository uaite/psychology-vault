The study of how we perceive sensory stimuli based on their physical characteristics. Started with the studies of german scientist Gustaf Fechner.

### Absolute threshold 

The lowest level of a stimulus we can detect fifty percent of the time when no other stimuli are present. For example, human visual systems can detect a single candle from 30 miles away on a clear night, or detect a small when as few as 50 airborne odorant molecules are present.

### Just noticeable difference (JND)

The smallest change in the intensity of a stimulus that can be detected. This is relevant to the ability of distinguishing a stronger from a weaker stimulus. **Weber's law** dictates that there's a constant proportional relationship between the JND and the original stimulus strength, meaning that the stronger the stimulus, the bigger the change needs to be for it to be noticeable.

### Signal detection theory

Describes how we detect stimuli under certain conditions, like understanding someone over the phone when there's static in the call. When there's a lot of background noise, it becomes harder to detect a signal (signal-to-noise ratio).

This is also relevant for response biases and filtering false-negatives and false-positives in research. Some people have a tendency to say *yes* as a default response when the signal is unclear, others would say *no*.
