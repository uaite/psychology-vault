Flexible , morattention is essential for survival considering the amount of sensory inputs happening all around. To focus on something, we must ignore so many more stimuli. **Selective attention** is the name of the process that allows it.

### Filter theory of attention

Proposed by Donald Broadbent (1957), the filter theory of attention views it as a bottleneck through which information passes. Tested using **dichotic listening**, where participants hear two different messages delivered to each ear. When asked to ignore the messages of one ear, they couldn't elaborate on the content or would get the contents mixed between both messages.

 > *[...] some of the information they were supposed to ignore, especially if it made sense to add it. If the attended ear heard, “I saw the girl . . . song was wishing,” and the unattended ear heard, “me that bird . . . jumping in the street,” a participant might hear “I saw the girl jumping in the street,” because the combination forms a meaningful sentence*.

The information being filtered out is still processed at some level, even when we're not aware of it (Beaman, Bridges, & Scott, 2007). See the *cocktail party effect*.

### Inattentional blindness

Failure to detect stimuli that are in plain sight when attention is focused elsewhere.

Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris (1999, 2011) asked subjects to watch a video of people tossing a basketball back and forth quickly, and asked them to keep track of the passes. About half of the viewers failed to notice a woman dressed in a gorilla suit in the middle of the video.

There's also **change blindness**, which is a failure to detect obvious changes in one's environment.
