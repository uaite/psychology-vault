**Sensation** refers to the detection of physical energy by sense organs.

[[Perception]] is the brain's interpretation of these raw sensory inputs.

Sensation picks information up, perception assembles them into meaning.

The way the brain puts these signals together is often relying on expectations and prior experiences to fill in the gaps and simplify processing. 

The brain processes stimuli whenever a sense receptor is activated - the original of the activation doesn't matter. For example, when  rubbing the eyes, [phosphenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene) can occur, since the brain doesn't differentiate between light or touch activating the receptors in the eyes. The input is still processed as visual.

Furthermore, there is cross-modal processing that can produce different perceptual experiences. For example, the *McGurk effect* demonstrates how humans integrate visual and auditory information when processing spoken language, and how the brain automatically calculates the most probable sound given the information from the two sources. Not only there's cross-talk among different brain regions, but some brain regions also serve multiple purposes, like neurons in the auditory cortex also responding weakly to touch; or visual stimuli enhancing touch perception in the somatosensory cortex; or how blind people's brains activate the visual cortex when reading braille; among other examples.

### Synesthesia

A remarkable condition where people experience cross-modal sensations, like hearing sounds when seeing colors, or tasting colors. There are around 60 types of synesthesia identified to date.

### The binding problem

When we perceive an apple, different regions of the brain process different aspects of it. Somehow the brain puts it all together into a unified whole. 

One hypothesis is that rapid, coordinated activity across multiple cortical areas assists in binding (Engel & Singer, 2001). 

When we see the world, we rely on shape, motion, color, and depth cues, all of which take different amounts of time to detect individually
