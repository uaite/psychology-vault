Also known as Pavlovian conditioning. For the relation with [[Operant Conditioning]], see [[Putting classical and operant conditioning together]].

A form form learning in which animals start responding to a stimulus which was previously neutral, but has been paired with another stimulus that elicits an automatic response.

Pavlov's study consisted of placing a dog in a hardness and a collection tube into the salivary glands to study responses to meat powder. The unexpected result was that the dog started responding to previously neutral stimuli that became associated with the meat powder, like the researcher who brought it. The dog would start salivating when they heard the footsteps of the researcher approaching.

He later systematically studied this by repeatedly pairing a metronome, a neutral stimulus, to a the meat powder, an [[Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)]], eliciting an [[Unconditioned response (UCR)]], which was salivation.

As repetition went on, the dog learned to salivate just by hearing the metronome. He had learned to associate the sound of the metronome to the meat powder. Now, hearing the metronome by itself elicited a [[Conditioned response (CR)]] (salivating), and it had become a [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)]].

In most cases, the CR is similar to the UCR, but it's rarely identical. Pavlov's dogs salivated less from the CS (metronome) than the UCS (meat powder).

Classical conditioning may not need the subject to be conscious. It can occur to people who are in a vegetative state.

Classical conditioning is extremely replicable.

## Principles of classical conditioning

It occurs in three phases: acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery. 

Once a stimulus is conditioned, it often extends to related stimuli.

### Acquisition

The phase of gradually learning the [[Conditioned response (CR)|CR]]. It's the phase where the CR is established.

As the [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CS]] and [[Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)|UCS]] are paired together, the CR increases in strength. In general, the closer they're paired together in time, the faster learning happens, with about a half-second delay typically being optimal. Longer delays usually decrease the speed and strength of the response, since this decreases the perception that the stimuli are related.

**Backward conditioning**, where the UCS is presented before the CS, is extremely difficult to achieve. For conditioning to be effective, the CS needs to forecast the UCS. This also makes sense evolutionarily from a causality perspective.

### Extinction

A gradual reduction and eventual elimination of the [[Conditioned response (CR)|CR]] after the [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CS]] is presented repeatedly without the [[Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)|UCS]].

Extinction is different from forgetting as it is an active process from which a new response is formed. In Pavlov's dog's case, the **absence** of salivation overwrites the salivation response.

### Spontaneous recovery

A sudden reemergence of an extinct [[Conditioned response (CR)|CR]] after a delay in exposure to the [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CS]].

This corroborates with the active nature of extinction. The CR is merely in the background and surfaces when it becomes relevant.

In Pavlov's experiment, he presented the CS (metronome) alone repeatedly until the CR (salivation) was extinct because there was no [[Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)|UCS]] (meat powder) following it. Two hours later, presenting the CS made the dog salivate again.

There's a related phenomenon called the **renewal effect**, which happens when a response is extinguished in a setting different from where it was learned. When returning to the learned setting, the extinct response resurfaces.

### Stimulus generalization

Pavlov also found the the dogs also responded to sounds similar to the metronome. 

The process of **stimulus generalization** poses that [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CSs]] similar to the original [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CS]] cause a [[Conditioned response (CR)]]. 

This occurs along a **generalization gradient**, meaning more similar stimuli trigger stronger CRs.

### Stimulus discrimination

The flipside of [[#Stimulus generalization]]. It happens when a less pronunced [[Conditioned response (CR)|CR]] is triggered from [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CSs]] that are different from the original CS.

This helps understanding why people enjoy scary movies, for example. We are capable of differentiating the film footage from the real thing, and have a different response.

### Equipotentiality

The belief held by many behaviorists that all CSs can be classically conditioned equally well to all UCSs. See [[Biological Influences]] for notes on how this was disproven.

## Higher-order conditioning


Taking conditioning further, organisms can develop a [[Conditioned response (CR)|conditioned response]] to a [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|conditioned stimulus]] by association with another CS. 

For example, if after conditioning a dog to salivate to a metronome, the researcher pair it with a picture of a circle, the dog would eventually salivate to the circle as well.

Each progressive level of association results in weaker conditioning. Fourth-order conditioning or more is typically difficult or impossible to achieve.

Many addictions are shaped in part by HOC, with the setting serving as higher-order [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CSs]]. A good example is how 86% of Vietnam veterans lost their heroin addiction shortly after returning to the US because the context change and their classically conditioned response extinguished.

## Applications to daily life

Classical conditioning is paramount for developing physiological associations to stimuli signaling biologically important events, and many of the responses contribute to survival. Salivating in response to anticipating food helps with digestion, for example.

### Advertising

Marketing campaigns seek to create [[Conditioned response (CR)|CRs]] by associating their brand with positive emotions. Research show that this works. Things like pairing products to sunsets, sensual music, images of attractive individuals, and celebrities all work.

Many researchers have paired products with pleasurable stimuli unsuccessfully, but there's a rival explanation in **latent inhibition**. Their failure might be related to the fact the brand was already familiar to the participants. When using novel brands, classical conditioning effects have generally been visible.

#### Latent inhibition

When people have experienced a [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)]] alone many times, it's difficult to condition it to another stimulus. 

### Acquiring fears and phobias

The question of how we develop fear or avoidance to stimuli was answered in 1920 by the father of behaviorism, John Watson, with his experiment with Little Albert.

Nine-month old Little Albert was set to play with a white rat, which he was fond of. A few seconds later, the researchers would strike a gong with a steel hammer, startling him. After seven pairings of the [[Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)|UCS]] (the gong), Little Albert displayed a [[Conditioned response (CR)|CR]] to the rat alone, so the rat had become a [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CS]]. He also displayed generalization, crying to other furry animals and some items, but not all, also showing discrimination. 

Needless to say, this experiment of inducing a phobia in a baby is unethical and would not work today.

Classical conditioning can also help overcoming phobias, not only creating them. Mary Cover Jones (1924), a student of Watson, treated a phobia of rabbits in a three-year old by gradually introducing him to a white rabbit while giving him his favorite candy. Eventually, the rabbit started triggering a new [[Conditioned response (CR)|CR]] of pleasure rather than fear.

### Fetishism

Defined as sexual attraction to nonliving things, it may also arise from partly classical conditioning.

Researchers were able to induce a fetish to a cylindrical object in male quails by presenting the object followed by a female quail. After 30 pairings, about half of the male quails attempted mating with the object when it appeared alone. The generalizability of these findings to humans is unclear, but some people seem to develop fetishes by repeated pairings of neutral objects with sexual activity.

### Disgust

In many cases, disgust reactions are related to stimuli that are biologically important, like animals or objects that are dirty or potentially poisonous.

Most disgust reactions are probably a product of classical conditioning.

In a study, researchers asked participants to drink from two glasses of water, both with sugar added. One bottle had the label "Sucrose", and the other had "Poison". Even though the participants were told both bottles were safe, they were hesitant to drink from the bottle with the poison label.
