Learning is defined as a change in an organisms behavior or thought as a result of experience.

When learning, the brain physically changes through chemical alterations.

## Habituation

When a stimuli is repeated over time, we respond less strongly to it. Think of closing the eyes and noticing things that pass by most of the time, like soft buzzing sounds of everyday life, or the feeling of clothes on the skin. Snorers remain asleep through the noise because they have become habituated to it.

Habituation is the simplest and earliest form of learning, starting from 32 weeks of pregnancy.

Through studying slugs, researcher Eric Kandel found that habituation is accompanied by a progressive decline in [[Serotonin]] release.

Habituation has also been studied through hand sweat linked to anxiety. This showed that habituation happens faster for weak stimuli than for strong stimuli. 

Very strong stimuli show no habituation at all. This makes sense evolutionarily since ignoring something dangerous wouldn't be good.

Some cases of repeated exposure lead to **sensitization** instead. This most likely happens when a stimulus is dangerous, irritating, or both.
