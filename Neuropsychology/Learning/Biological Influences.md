Biology influences the speed and nature of learning in complex ways.

## Conditioned taste aversions

This finding is important for contradicting [[Classical Conditioning#Equipotentiality|equipotentiality]].

Also known as **sauce béarnaise syndrome** due to the researcher, Seligman, who once had a terrible experience of becoming very ill following eating his favorite sauce on top of steak and became forever nauseated just at the thought of sauce béarnaise.

In more scientific terms, **conditioned taste aversion** refers to how [[Classical Conditioning|classical conditioning]] can cause the development of avoidance reactions to the taste of certain foods. This tale contradicts CC in three ways:

1. Conditioned taste aversions typically only require one trial to develop, not repeated ones;
2. The delay between CS (thinking of sauce) and UCS (feeling ill) can be many hours;
3. The aversions tend to be very specific and don't display [[Classical Conditioning#Stimulus generalization|stimulus generalization]]. 

These differences make sense from an evolutionary standpoint, since organisms wouldn't want to experience food poisoning many times before learning an association. This could be unpleasant, but most of all, dangerous. The time difference violates CC principles, but in this case, the delayed association is adaptive since it teaches us to avoid foods we consumed hours earlier.

This condition is a particular problem for people undergoing chemotherapy, since it frequently induces nausea and vomiting. The patient can accidentally develop several aversions to any food that preceded chemotherapy, even if they understand where it comes from. This is why the concept of **scapegoat foods** exist, trying to keep the aversion within foods the patient already doesn't like very much.

Research has demonstrated rats developing a conditioned taste aversion also just from one interaction, although it was limited to being associated with a specific taste.

## Phobias and Preparedness

This finding is important for contradicting [[Classical Conditioning#Equipotentiality|equipotentiality]].

An interesting fact about phobias is that people aren't always afraid of the things they've had the most frequent unpleasant experiences with. Common phobias like the dark, heights, snakes, spiders, deep water, and blood occur in people who haven't had many encounters with their fear. At the same time, several dangerous objects who hurt us daily like razors, knives, the corners of furniture, ovens, and electrical outlets aren't objects of phobias very often.

Seligman (1971) posed that the distribution of phobias can be explained by [[#Preparedness]].

This is also visible in the study by Mineka and Michael Cook (1993), in which they showed monkeys who never had exposure to snakes videos of other monkeys reacting in horror to snakes. Within less than 30 minutes, [[observational learning]] kicked in and they developed a fear of snakes. The video was then edited to replace the snake with flowers, a toy rabbit, a toy snake, or a toy crocodile. After exposure to these tapes, different groups of monkeys with no previous contact to any of those items only developed fears of the toy snake and toy crocodile, but not the toy rabbit or the flower. Taking [[#Preparedness]] into account, this makes sense.
### Preparedness

The evolutionary predisposition to learn some pairings of feared stimuli over others owing to their survival value. In other words, prepared fears are "evolutionary memories", legacies of natural selection. Household items weren't dangerous to human ancestors, but cliffs and venomous animals were.

This concept may impact the creation of **illusory correlations** between fear-provoking stimuli and negative consequences. In a study, a group of people with fear of snakes, and one without, were set to watch slides of snakes and damaged electrical outlets paired with intermittent electrical shocks. The shocks were completely random, there was no correlation between them and the slides. However, people who already had a fear of snakes found an illusory correlation between a snake appearing, and not the electrical outlet, and the shocks. Subjects with low fear levels didn't make this correlation. In short, it seems like the people who feared snakes were already on the lookout for any threatening stimuli that might signal snakes, so they overestimated how often the snake and electrical shock combination happened. Again, preparedness may be at work here, because snakes were dangerous for humans ancestors, but electrical outlets weren't.

Still, the evidence for preparedness isn't consistent. The findings that people acquire fears to prepared stimuli faster than unprepared stimuli weren't well replicated. Some authors have also proposed that preparedness might have an alternative explanation which isn't evolutionary: [[Classical Conditioning#Latent inhibition|latent inhibition]]. Daily items might be difficult to condition since there's a strong neutral association to them already.

### Genetic influences

Genetic influences probably play a role in the acquisition of certain phobias. Many phobias exist without a difference in the number of encounters between people who have those phobias, and many people have never have any encounters with their object of fear. This makes it unlikely that [[Classical Conditioning]] is the only explanation. It seems like some people are genetically predisposed to develop certain phobias *given* a history of certain conditioning experiences.

## Instinctive drift

Animal trainers Marian and Keller Breland taught many animals many tricks using behaviorist techniques. In this process, they found that the animals didn't behave as expected all the time. After successfully teaching raccoons to drop coins into a piggybank, despite the repeated reinforcement, the raccoons reverted to one innate behavior of their species by rubbing the coins together, dropping them, then rubbing them together again. This behavior, called rinsing is what raccoons do in nature with the shells they get from ponds and streams.

Breland and Breland (1961) coined the term **instinctive drift** to refer to the tendency of animals to return to innate behaviors following repeated reinforcement. This has also been observed in other animals.
