The similarities between classical and operant conditioning, including all their key aspects of acquisition, extinction, stimulus generalization, and so on, have led some theorists to pose that they aren't so different after all (Brown & Jenkins, 1968; Staddon & Cerutti, 2003).

Although there are similarities, brain-imaging studies show they activate different brain regions. Classically conditioned fear reactions are often mostly in the amygdala, whereas operantly conditioned ones come from brain areas rich in dopamine, which are linked to reward.

Anyway, these two forms of conditioning often interact. Some phobias come from classical conditioning - a dog ([[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CS]]) can be paired with a dog bite ([[Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)|UCS]]), resulting in the [[Conditioned response (CR)|CR]] of fear. However, this doesn't answer why the CR of fear is so resistant, and many people with phobias remain extremely afraid for years.

## Two-process theory

A theory which explains the persistence of anxiety disorders by the lens of both classical conditioning and operant conditioning. 

It states that phobias come initially from classical conditioning. Then, once the fear is set, people start avoiding their feared stimuli whenever it's encountered. When they do, they experience a reduction in anxiety and [[Operant Conditioning#Reinforcement|negatively reinforce]] their fear. 

Two-process theory points to an effective treatment to phobias in the form of exposure therapy, which is the treatment for anxiety disorders with the best support.
