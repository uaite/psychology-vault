 InsA type of learning controlled by the consequences of an organisms behavior. Also called **instrumental conditioning** because the organism gets something out of the interaction, like food, sex, attention, or avoiding something unpleasant.

For the relation with [[Classical Conditioning]], see [[Putting classical and operant conditioning together]].

Some examples:

> - Using bird feed as a reward, a behavioral psychologist teaches a pigeon to distinguish paintings by Monet from paintings by Picasso. By the end of the training, the pigeon is a veritable art aficionado. 
> - Using fish as a treat, a trainer teaches a dolphin to jump out of the water, spin three times, splash in the water, and propel itself through a hoop.
> - In his initial attempt at playing tennis, a frustrated 12-year-old hits his opponent’s serve into the net the first 15 times. After two hours of practice, he returns his opponent’s serve successfully more than half the time. 
> - A hospitalized patient with dissociative identity disorder (formerly known as multiple personality disorder) displays features of an “alter” personality whenever staff members pay attention to him. When they ignore him, his alter personality seemingly vanishes.

All of these behaviors are shaped by the reward that comes afterward.

## Differences from Classical Conditioning

Compared to [[Classical Conditioning|classical conditioning]], in operant conditioning:
- the target behavior is voluntary (emitted), not automatic (elicited);
- the reward is contingent on behavior;
- the behavior depends mostly on skeletal muscles, instead of the [[Peripheral nervous system (PNS)#Autonomic nervous system|autonomic nervous system]]. CC involves changes in heart rate, breathing, perspiration, and other bodily systems, while OC involves changes in voluntary motor behavior.

## The law of effect

A principle proposed by psychologist E.L. Thorndike which forms the basis of part of operant conditioning. 

> If a response, in the presence of a stimulus, is followed by a satisfying state of affairs, the bond between stimulus and response will be strengthened.

In other words, if there is a reward, organisms are more likely to repeat that same response for that stimulus. As such, early behaviorism used to be called S-R psychology (stimulus-response). S-R psychologists state that most complex behaviors stem from progressive accumulation of associations between stimuli and responses.

An important study by Thorndike consisted of placing a cat inside a box with food outside it. To open the box and reach the food, the cat needed to press on a lever or pull a string inside the box. At first, the cat flailed around until it stumbled upon the solution. Gradually, the cat took less time to escape the box, but there was no "aha!" moment where the cat had **insight** into the solution. The cat never grasped the nature of the problem, just built up more S-R associations.

Thorndike argues that, if the cat had insight, the chart for the time to solve the problem would look like the image above, but that was never the case. It was gradually slower.

## Reinforcement Learning (B.F. Skinner)

Skinner built upon Thorndike's discoveries. He created the **operant chamber** (informally, the Skinner box), which electronically records an animal's responses and prints out a cumulative record of their activity. Typically, the box contains a bar that delivers food on press, a food dispenser, and often a light for signaling when a reward is coming.

### Reinforcement

Skinner argued that the term **reward** as imprecise because it doesn't specify how the organisms behavior changes in response to the reward. He proposed the term **reinforcement**, meaning any outcome that increases the probability of a response. With this, it's possible to differentiate between **positive reinforcement** and **negative reinforcement**. Note that reinforcement, different from a reward, is only classified as a reinforcement only when it makes the response more likely to occur.

**Positive reinforcement** - When a stimulus is administered, the likelihood of the behavior increases
For example, giving chocolate to a kid for organizing their room

**Negative reinforcement** - When a stimulus is removed, the likelihood of the behavior increases
For example, ending a child's time-out when they've stopped crying

### Punishment

On the flipside of reinforcement, there's the definition of **punishment**, which can also be positive and negative. 

**Positive punishment** - When a stimulus is administered, the likelihood of the behavior decreases
For example, scolding a child for pushing another

**Negative punishment** - When a stimulus is removed, the likelihood of the behavior decreases
For example, taking away a child's favorite toy when they throw a tantrum

Positive punishment typically involves administering a stimulus that the organism wants to avoid. Negative punishment, similarly, involves removing a stimulus that the organism wants to experience.

It's important to note that the word punishment here isn't tied to disciplinary practices. Discipline is punishment only if it decreases the probability of the behavior. Skinner argues that certain actions that might appear to be punishing are actually reinforcing, and defined them only based on their outcomes. For example, if a child's bad behavior happens more as a result of scolding, it's actually a reinforcement.

Skinner poses that punishment works for changing behavior, but that reinforcement alone could shape it for the better. He argues against punishment due to several disadvantages:

1. Punishment tells the organism only what **not to do**, not what **to do** instead. It's not constructive;
2. Punishment often creates anxiety, which can hinder learning;
3. Punishment can encourage subversive behavior, like still performing a forbidden behavior, only sneakily or in secret;
4. Punishment may provide a model for aggressive behavior, so a child who gets slapped for misbehaving might learn that slapping is acceptable. There's multiple studies showing a correlation between physical punishment from parents and aggressive behavior in children, although it doesn't show causation. There are other explanations, like genetic predisposition, or that aggressive children elicit physical abuse by being more difficult to control.

Most research suggests that punishment works best when it's delivered consistently following the undesired behavior. Immediate punishment tends to be effective, while delayed punishment is often useless. Punishment also works best when simultaneously reinforcing a desired behavior by showing the organism what to do.

### Discriminative stimulus

Any stimulus that signals the presence of reinforcement. Not to be confused with [[Classical Conditioning#Stimulus discrimination|stimulus discrimination]].

For example, a dog coming over after someone snapping their fingers, expecting to be pet. The finger snapping is a discriminative stimulus, signaling that it will receive reinforcement.

### Extinction

In operant conditioning, extinction happens when a previously reinforced behavior no longer gets administered reinforcers, gradually decreasing in frequency and eventually disappearing. If parents give a screaming child their toy to quiet them, they might be reinforcing the screaming behavior. However, they could get earplugs and stop giving in, gradually extinguishing their behavior. In cases like this, **extinction burst** can often happen.

#### Extinction burst

Right before a reinforcer is withdrawn, the undesired behavior can increase in intensity, because the organism is trying hard to be reinforced.

### Shaping

Conditioning a target behavior by progressively reinforcing behavior that come closer and closer to the target behavior. Typically, it starts by reinforcing most or all responses that are close to the desired behavior, then gradually **fading** the incorrect behaviors over time, meaning decreasing the frequency of reinforcement for them.

### Primary reinforcer

Item or outcome that naturally increases the target behavior.

### Secondary reinforcer

Neutral objects that become associated with primary reinforcers, like a favorite food or drink, that naturally increase the target behavior.

### Other key concepts

Acquisition, spontaneous recovery, stimulus generalization, and stimulus discrimination, are all equivalent to [[Classical Conditioning]].

## Schedules of reinforcement

Skinner also found that behaviors differ depending on the **schedule** of reinforcement. In the simplest pattern, **continuous reinforcement** and **partial** or **intermittent** reinforcement.

**Continuous reinforcement** - a behavior is reinforced every time it happens
In this pattern, learning happens faster, but extinction happens faster too

**Partial/Intermittent reinforcement** - a behavior is reinforced only some of the time
In this pattern, the behavior is prone to lasting longer, but learning is slower

The idea that intermittent reinforcement creates more resistant behaviors makes sense. If an animal gets rewarded every time for some behavior, they will want to continue only as long as the behavior is reinforced.

There are numerous schedules of reinforcement, but four major ones which are consistently replicable across several species. These schedules vary along two dimensions:

1. **The consistency of administering reinforcements**. Some are fixed, others are variable. Variable schedules tend to yield more consistent rates of responding, which makes sense - if we don't know when the next reward is coming, it's best to keep emitting the response just to be sure.
2. **The basis of administering reinforcement**. Some are based on ratio, others on interval. In ratio schedules, the organism is reinforced based on the number of responses. In interval schedules, they're reinforced based on the amount of time elapsed since the last reinforcement.

Combining these two dimensions creates four reinforcement schedules:

![[image-12 2.png]]

### Fixed ratio schedule (FR)

Provide reinforcement after a regular number of responses. For example, a researcher could give a rat a pellet after it pressed the lever in the Skinner box 15 times.

### Variable ratio schedule (VR)

Provide reinforcement after a specific number of responses on average, but the precise number of responses required during any given period varies randomly. For example, a pigeon on a VR schedule with an average of 10 might receive a piece of bird feed after 6 pecks, then 12 pecks, then 1 peck, then 21 pecks, with the average of these ratios being 10.

Variable ratio schedules usually yield the highest rates of responding. It's why they're used on casinos. The extreme unpredictability of VR schedules is what keeps gamblers hooked, since a huge reinforcement could come at any time. Skinner found the same behavior on pigeons, who could continue to peck on a disk for over 150,000 non-reinforced responses.

### Fixed interval schedule (FI)

Provide reinforcement for producing the response at least once after a specified amount of time has passed. For example, a worker in a clock factory might get paid every Friday, as long as they've generated at least one clock during that one-week interval.

FI schedules are especially distinctive in the behaviors they create. The pattern it creates shows the organism waits for a time after it receives reinforcement, then increases the response rate just before the interval is up as they're anticipating reinforcement.

### Variable interval schedule (VI)

Provide reinforcement for producing the response after an average time interval, with the actual interval varying randomly. For example, a dog could get a treat for performing a trick on a variable interval schedule with an average of 8 minutes. This dog may have to perform the trick sometime during a 7-minute interval, then a 1-minute interval, then a 20-minute interval, then a 4-minute interval, with the average of these intervals being 8 minutes.

## Applications

Operant conditioning appears in many everyday experiences and in some special circumstances. It's important for parenting, animal training, weight-loss plans, mastering a game, and more.

### Animal training

Behaviorists typically train animals by [[#Shaping|shaping]], along with another technique called **chaining**.

**Chaining** - Linking a number of related behaviors to form a longer series. Each behavior becomes a cue for the next.

Skinner famously trained pigeons to play ping-pong by shaping and chaining.

### Overcoming procrastination

There are several potential solutions for procrastination, which is a difficult and harmful problem to deal with. David Premack (1965) showed with his research on monkeys that it's possible to [[#Reinforcement|positively reinforce]] a less frequent behavior with a more frequent behavior. This isn't foolproof, but typically works surprisingly well. For example, only reinforcing yourself with a TV show, or a favorite chocolate, once you've completed your homework.

### Therapy

Operant conditioning can be used in clinical settings. One of the most successful applications is the **token economy**.
#### Token economy

A system often set up in psychiatric hospitals for reinforcing appropriate behaviors and extinguishing inappropriate ones. Psychologists will identify target behaviors, and staff members reinforce patients with those behaviors using tokens, chips, points, or other [[#Secondary reinforcer|secondary reinforcers]].

As an example, in a hospital where children had many behavior problems, like yelling and cursing, one target behavior was being polite to staff members. Whenever a child was especially polite, they were rewarded with points, which could be traded for things like ice cream or attending a movie night. Whenever a child was rude, they lost points.

Research shows that token economies are often effective methods for improving behavior in hospital, group homes, and juvenile detention units, but they are controversial. The behaviors learned in the institutions don't always transfer to the outside world, especially if the patients return to poor settings.

#### Applied behavior analysis (ABA)

An effective treatment for individuals with autism. ABA for autism uses [[#Shaping|shaping]] techniques: mental health professionals offer primary reinforcers like food to individuals with autism as they progressively reach closer approximations to certain words, and eventually, complete sentences.

However, research is still spotty. The current consensus is that ABA isn't a miracle cure for the language deficits of autism, but it can be very helpful in many cases.
