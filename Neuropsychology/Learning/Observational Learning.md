An important variation of [[Latent Learning]] is **observational learning**, defined as learning by watching others (Bandura, 1965; Singer-Dudek, Cho, & Lyons, 2013).

We can learn many things by watching **models**, like parents, teachers, and others who are influential to us. Many psychologists regard observational learning as a form of latent learning since it happens without reinforcement. We could only watch someone else being reinforced for doing a task and learn from them.

A very simple example is how we don't need to jump out of a plane to learn that we need to wear a parachute. Only watching someone skydiving and opening the parachute is enough to learn how it works. Observational learning can help us avoid life-threatening mistakes like this, but it can also contribute to learning maladaptive habits.

## Learning aggression

Albert Bandura and colleagues demonstrated children can learn to act aggressively by watching aggressive role models (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963).

They asked children to watch an adult interacting with a Bobo doll, randomly assigning some to watch an adult playing quietly and ignoring the Bobo doll, and others to watch the adult hitting it with punches and mallet while shouting and insulting it. After watching, the children were brought to a room with several toys, only to be interrupted once they began playing to frustrate them. Then, they were moved to another room with the same Bobo doll.

On several measures, the study showed that children exposed to the aggressive model had significantly more aggressive behavior towards the Bobo doll, even imitating some of the verbal insults. This was later replicated in a separate study with models on film rather than in person.

### Media violence

The studies on aggression led psychologists to question if exposure to media violence contribute to real-world violence. There's a lot of literature on this topic.

Hundreds of correlational design studies have reported that children who watch many violent TV shows are more aggressive than other children, but these findings don't demonstrate causality. They could be showing that highly aggressive children are more likely to engage with violent media; or could be the result of a third variable, like the child's initial levels of aggressiveness. 

To get around this, longitudinal studies can offer more compelling evidence by analyzing the behavior over time. These studies show that children who choose to watch violent TV shows commit more aggressive acts years later than children who watch them less, even when equating children in their initial aggression levels. However, this is not an experiment, so it still doesn't demonstrate causality, so there are unmeasured personality and social variables.

Other researchers have examined if the link between media and aggression holds up in laboratory settings, and, in general, these studies strongly suggest a causal association between media violence and laboratory aggression (Wood, Wong, & Chachere, 1991). The same conclusion might be drawn for video-games, but the causal link in this case is controversial and less established (Ferguson, 2009; Ferguson, 2015).

Finally, there have been field studies on the topic. These findings again show a link between violent media and aggression, but there are confounding variables (Williams, 1986).

The bottom line is that all investigation done so far points to a causal relation between media violence and aggression (Anderson et al., 2003; Carnagay, Anderson, & Bartholow, 2007). Still, it's equally clear that media violence is only a tiny piece of the puzzle. It doesn't explain aggression by itself because the majority of individuals exposed to high levels of media violence don't become aggressive.
