Pioneered by Edward Chace Tolman, one of the first serious challenges to the radical behaviorist view. 

**Latent learning** is defined as learning that's not directly observable. Organisms learn many things would showing them, highlighting the difference between **competence** and **performance**. This is important because it implies that **reinforcement isn't necessary for learning**.

Tolman and C. H. Honzik (1930) demonstrated latent learning systematically through their experiment with three groups of rats, randomly assigned to go through a maze over a three-week period.

One group always received reinforcement when reaching the end of the maze, another never got any reinforcement, and the last group didn't get reinforcements for 10 days, which changed on the 11th day. As shown on the image above, the first group did better, as expected, but there's an abrupt drop in the number of errors of the 3rd group right after the first reinforcer, and they start matching the first group.

Tolman's argument is that the rats in the third group had been learning all along, they just didn't show it because there was nothing to gain from it. Once there was something in it for them, they started performing.

According to Tolman, the rats had developed [[Cognitive Maps|cognitive maps]] of the maze.

The research on latent learning challenges strict behavioral models (see [[Classical Conditioning]] and [[Operant Conditioning]]). It suggests learning can happen without reinforcement, and that thinking, in the form of cognitive maps, is central to some kinds of learning.
