Behaviorists didn't believe thinking was of importance for learning. Skinner himself advocated for **radical behaviorism**, believing that observable behavior, thinking, and emotion are all governed by classical and operant conditioning. Radical behaviorists pose that thinking and emotion are behaviors in themselves, just unobservable.

## S-O-R Psychology

Psychology has since then moved on from this view, embracing **S-O-R psychology** instead of [[Operant Conditioning#The law of effect|S-R psychology]]. 

**S-O-R Psychology** - stimulus, organism, response
Poses that the organism's response to a stimulus depends on what the stimulus *means* to it.

This view provides a different explanation for two organisms reacting differently to the same stimulus. Say you complained to two friends that they showed up late, and one behaved apologetically, and the other, defensively. Skinner would argue these two people have different **learning histories**, that is, they've been trained differently to react to criticism. S-O-R theorists believe cognition is central, and so they would contend the difference comes from their **interpretation** of the criticism. 

S-O-R theorists don't reject classical and operant conditioning, they just believe there's another building block in the mix, and these forms of learning also depend on thinking. For a simple example, take a subject who's been classically conditioned by shocks ([[Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)|UCS]]) and tones ([[Conditioned response (CR)|CR]]) to sweat. When they're told there's no more shocks coming, the sweating stops. This shows **cognitive conditioning**, where their interpretation of the situation affects conditioning.

The role of expectations in learning is also important to S-O-R theorists. They point to how classical conditioning only happens if the [[Conditioned stimulus (CS)|CS]] regularly predicts the [[Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)|UCS]], not the other way around. The *thought* of "I think some reward is on the way" is important.
