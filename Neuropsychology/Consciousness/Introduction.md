**Consciousness** refers to the subjective experience of the world and the self, including the body.

Consciousness is what you lose when you fall into a deep sleep and what you gain when you wake up (Sanders, 2012). It's different from self-awareness, which can be retained when sleeping.

Most people can easily focus their attention when needed to respond to a situation. Alterations in awareness and the ability to control it are adaptive for other animals too. Some aquatic animals sleep with one side of their brains still awake.

There are numerous examples of how awareness and alertness changes continuously, and how consciousness is sensitively attuned to brain chemistry changes, expectations, and culture.
