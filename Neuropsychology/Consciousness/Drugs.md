A **psychoactive drug** is one that contains chemicals similar to those found naturally in the brain. They alter consciousness by changing chemical processes in neurons.

Some psychoactive drugs are used as treatment for physical and mental illnesses, but others are exclusively recreational. Their precise effects depend on the type of drug and dosage.

A lot of the effects of these drugs also depend on the **mental set**, that is, the beliefs and expectancies about the effects of the drug; and the **setting**, that is, the environment in which the drug is taken.

## Substance abuse

Generally speaking, **substance abuse disorder** is when the person experiences recurrent significant impairment or distress associated with one or more drugs. It's a relatively new diagnostic from the 5th edition of the DSM, and combines the previous categories of substance abuse and substance dependence. This new diagnostic considers the full range of problems, including recurrent problems at different environments, tolerance, and withdrawal.

**Tolerance** is a key feature of substance abuse disorders. It's characterized by the person needing a higher dosage of the drug to achieve intoxication. People may also not have the same "kick" from the drug after becoming tolerant.

When people use drugs for long periods of time and either stop or cut usage down, they may experience **withdrawal**, The symptoms vary from drug to drug. 

When a user needs to continue taking a drug to avoid withdrawal, they experience **physical dependence**.

When a user needs to satisfy an intense craving even when the drug causes problems, they experience **psychological dependence**.

### Explanations for use

People often begin using drugs when they become available, when they're approved by peers, and when they don't anticipate serious consequences. Illegal drug use typically begins in adolescence, peaks in early adulthood, and afterwards declines sharply.

#### Sociocultural influences

Cultures where drinking is strictly prohibited exhibit low rates of alcoholism. Cultures where drinking is viewed as a healthy part of daily life, the rate is considerably higher.

Some researchers attribute the abuse to the differences in attitude. However, they may also be in part due to genetic influences, and the cultural attitudes themselves may be a reflection.

#### Personality

Sociocultural factors don't explain differences *within* cultures. Research suggests there's no addictive personality profile, but also found that certain personality traits predispose to alcohol and drug abuse. In particular, impulsivity; the tendency to seek novel and stimulating sensory experiences; propensity to experience negative emotions, like anxiety and hostility; and a tendency to find a drug's effect particularly rewarding. However, some of these trains may result from substance misuse, rather than cause it.

#### Learning and expectancies

The **tension reduction hypothesis** poses that people consume drugs to relieve anxiety. Furthermore, some drugs affect the reward centers of the brain, including dopamine.

Nevertheless, people are most likely to consume alcohol when they expect it to reduce stress.

#### Genetic influences

Alcoholism tends to run in families. Genetic factors play a key role in the vulnerability to alcoholism, a fact found from twin studies.

A mutation in the ALDH2 gene causes a particularly unpleasant bodily response to alcohol, and it's present in about 40% of asian descendants, who are at low risk for alcoholism.

## Depressants

Drugs which depress the effects of the central nervous system, like alcohol and sedative-hypnotics (calming + sleep-inducing).

### Alcohol

Alcohol is the most widely used and abused drug. By late adolescence, 78.2% of young adults have consumed alcohol, and almost 60% report having consumed it in the last month. 51.8% of adult man regularly use alcohol.

Alcohol behaves as an emotional and  psychological stimulant only at low doses because it depresses the region of the brain that inhibit emotion and behavior. Small amounts of it can promote relaxation, elevated mood, increased talkativeness and activity, lowered inhibitions, and impaired judgement.

At higher doses, when the **blood alcohol content (BAC)** reaches 0.05 to 0.1, the sedating and depressant effects of alcohol become more apparent. Brain centers become more depressed, slowing thinking and impairing concentration, walking, and muscular coordination.

At even higher doses, users sometimes experience a mix of stimulating and sedating effects.

The short-term intoxication effects are directly related to the BAC. The feeling of intoxication depends largely on the rate of alcohol absorption, which is slowed down by the amount of food in the stomach. BAC is also influenced by body fat, since alcohol isn't fat-soluble. More body fat means less water in which to dilute alcohol, so the BAC is stronger.

Results of [[Research designs#Balanced placebo design|balanced placebo studies]] show that culturally learned expectations influence mood and social behaviors at low alcohol levels. Participants ingesting a placebo show many of the subjective effects of drunkenness. However, non-social behaviors are more influenced by alcohol itself than by expectations.

The **setting** also influences alcohol's effects. Participants feel happier or friendlier when drinking at a bar, for example, than people who drink by themselves.


### Sedative-hypnotics

These drugs produce depressant effect, are dangerous at high dosages, and can cause unconsciousness, coma, and even death.

They are divided into three categories: barbiturates, nonbarbiturates, and benzodiazepines.

Benzodiazepines were extremely popular in the 60s and 70s, and are still widely used today to relieve anxiety. 

Barbiturates have the greatest abuse potential and overdoses are often fatal.

## Stimulants

Drugs which increases activity in the central nervous system, including heart rate, perspiration, and blood pressure.

### Nicotine

Activates receptors sensitive to [[Acetylcholine|acetylcholine]]. Smokers often report feelings of stimulation, relaxation, and alertness.

Nicotine has **adjustive value**, meaning it can enhance positive emotional reactions and minimize negative emotional reactions.

### Cocaine

The most powerful natural stimulant. Users report euphoria, enhanced mental and physical capacity, stimulation, decrease in hunger, indifference to pain, and a sense of well-being accompanied by diminished fatigue.

It's a powerful reinforcer. Monkeys can even "dose themselves to death" if unlimited quantities are available. 

Cocaine increases the activity of [[Dopamine]] and possibly [[Serotonin]], contributing to its reinforcing effects. It also affects brain regions associated with behavior, insight, and emotional self-awareness, fueling the addictive effects. The cocaine high is short-lived and followed by unpleasant feelings, which often leads to redosing.

Chronic cocaine use is associated with decreases in grey matter. However, this can be questioned: were the changes produced by cocaine, or did they happen before cocaine dependence and increase the risk for dependence?

### Amphetamines

A class of drugs that decreases fatigue, and enhances mood and well-being. 

One pattern of use is occasionally using small doses of oral amphetamines to postpone tiredness, perform unpleasant tasks, or cram for a test. 

Another pattern is obtaining amphetamines from a doctor, but consuming them on a regular basis for euphoria rather than the prescribed purpose.

The third pattern is associated with street users, who inject large doses of amphetamines to get a rush of pleasure following the injection. These users are likely to be restless, talkative, excited, and to inject repeatedly. Inability to sleep and loss of appetite are also common in this case. These users may become increasingly suspicious, hostile, and paranoid.

Methamphetamine is also a drug of abuse. Users experience intense euphoria that can last 12 to 16 hours. Crystal meth is more powerful than regular amphetamines, has a higher purity level, and has higher risk for overdose and dependence. Meth can destroy tissues and blood vessels, cause acne, and lead to weight loss, tremors, and dental problems.

## Narcotics

Drugs for relieving pain and inducing sleep, including opioids like heroin, morphine, and codeine.

Heroin produces a strong sense of euphoria for 3 to 4 hours. Addicted people who don't take another dose within 4 to 6 hours experience  withdrawal symptoms, including abdominal cramps, vomiting, craving, yawning, runny nose, sweating, and chills. The sleep-inducing properties of heroin come from the depressant effects on the [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]].

People who use opioids for medical purposes as prescribed don't necessarily develop addiction.

## Psychedelics

Drugs which cause dramatic alterations in perception, mood, and though. Includes LSD, mescaline, MDMA, and more mildly, marijuana. 

These drugs are of interest for treating many psychological conditions, including depression, drug addiction, PTSD, OCD, and anxiety. Under controlled conditions, initial findings are encouraging, but positive effects tend to disappear after a few days. There are also unpredictable effects, like possibly producing panic, paranoid delusions, confusion, depression, and bodily discomfort ("bad trip"). 

Persistent psychotic or negative reactions triggered by hallucinogens are probably rare events in individuals with no history of prior mental disorders. However, flashbacks occur on occasion. 

### Marijuana

The subjective effects of weed are produced by THC. People experience a "high" feeling within a few minutes with short-term effects. Effects include a sense of time slowing down, enhanced sensations of touch, increased appreciation for sounds, hunger, feelings of well-being, and a tendency to giggle. Later, they may become quiet, introspective, and sleepy.

At higher doses, users may have disturbances in short-term memory, exaggerated emotions, and an altered sense of self. Others may experience difficulty concentrating, slowed thought, depersonalization, and, more rarely, extreme anxiety, panic, and psychosis. 

The effects begin when THC reaches the brain, stimulating cannabinoid receptors. They are concentrated in areas that control pleasure, perception, memory, and coordinated body movements. The primary physiological changes are increased heart rate, reddening of the eyes, and dryness of the mouth.

Marijuana produces more damage to cells than tobacco smoke and an increased risk of lung and respiratory disease, but there isn't consistent evidence for serious physical health. 

Chronic heavy use can impair attention and memory, but cognitive functioning is restored after a month of abstinence.

Some researchers argue that marijuana is a "gateway" drug, but it's hard to determine cause and effect.

### LSD and psilocybin

LSD was accidentally experienced in 1943 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann.

The psychedelic effects of LSD may stem from its interference with [[Serotonin]] at the synapse. They're also linked to areas of the brain rich in [[Dopamine]]. 

Even tiny amounts of LSD can produce dramatic shifts in perceptions and consciousness. Some users report extremely clear thoughts and fascinating changes in sensations and perceptions, including [[Neuropsychology/Sensation and Perception/Introduction#Synesthesia|synesthesia]]. Others report mystical experiences.

LSD produces these incredible effects through several physiological effects. Research shows decreased electrical activity in the brain, increased blood flow, and greatly improved communication among neural networks, especially those related to the visual cortex. This is correlated to the hallucinatory effects.

As the connections in the visual cortex are ramped up, others are damped down, which explains the feeling of ego dissolution. This is similar to psilocybin.

Researchers have also observed communication in networks that normally don't talk to each other, providing an explanation for the rich multisensory experiences.

### MDMA

Ecstasy has both stimulant and hallucinogenic components. It produces cascades of [[Serotonin]], increasing self-confidence and well-being, and producing powerful feelings of empthy.
