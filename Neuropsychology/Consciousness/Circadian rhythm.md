Cyclical changes that happen on a roughly 24-hour basis in several biological processes in the body, including hormone release, brain waves, body temperature, and drowsiness. This is coordinated by about 20,000 neurons in the hypothalamus, a structure commonly known as the **biological clock**.

The biological clock ticks even inside red blood cells (Edgar et al., 2012).

When disrupted, it disturbs sleep and increases the risk of injuries, fatal accidents, and health problems like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease (Åkerstedt et al., 2002; Kirkcaldy, Levine, & Shephard, 2000; Parsons et al., 2015).

## Melatonin 

**Melatonin** is the hormone that increases after dark when approaching sleep time, triggering feelings of sleepiness. Plays a key role in regulating circadian rhythms.
