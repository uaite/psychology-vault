The experience of becoming aware of your own dreams.

Using brain imaging, researchers found that parts of the cerebral cortex associated with self-perception and evaluating thoughts and feelings are active when lucid dreaming (Dresler et al, 2012). Another study measured electrical activity in the brain, finding suggestive evidence that lucid dreaming is a mixed state of consciousness since it has both waking and REM sleep features.

The ability to lucid dream can improve a nightmare's outcome, but there's no evidence that something like this helps with mood disorders.
