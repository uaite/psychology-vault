Essentially everyone dreams, but people may not recall their dreams after waking. Almost everyone who's awakened during REM sleep reports vivid dreaming (Dement, 1974; Domhoff & Schneider, 2004), but a handful don't (Butler & Watson, 1985; Pagel, 2003).

Most dreams contain more aggression than friendliness, more negative than positive emotions, and more misfortune than good fortune. 

Evidence suggests dreams are involved in:
- processing emotional memories (Malinoski & Horton, 2015; Maquet & Franck, 1997);
- integrating new experiences with established memories to make sense of the world, including socially (Hobson, 2009; Revonsuo, Tuominen, & Valli, 2015; Stickgold, James, & Hobson, 2002);
- learning new strategies and ways of doing things (Walker et al., 2002);
- simulating threatening events for better coping (Revonsuo, 2000; Robert & Zadra, 2014);
- reorganizing and consolidating memories (Crick & Mitchison, 1983; Diekelmann & Born, 2010).

However, the function of dreams remains puzzling because evidence is mixed.

## Freud's dream theory

According to Freud, the ego is less capable of suppressing sexual and aggressive urges during sleep. He said dreams exist to help stop these instincts from disturbing sleep, transforming these symbols into **wish fulfillment**.

Freud also says dreams need interpretation to reveal their meaning. The dream has two parts: the content itself, **manifest content**, and the hidden meaning, the **latent content**. For example, dreaming about a flat tire might mean anxiety about losing your job.

Most scientists have since rejected this theory. It's been challenged in several fronts. Wish fulfillment doesn't ring true since a lot of dreams are negative. Sexual dreams also aren't very common and account for 10% of dreams people remember (Domhoff, 2003). Most dreams are also very straightforward descriptions of everyday activities.

## Nightmares

Nightmares can negatively impact sleep quality, especially if they are recurring and trauma-related. This can be improved with psychotherapy using **imagery rehearsal therapy**. People who write down and rehearse a replacement dream report sharp reductions in nightmare frequency, improved sleep quality, and decreased symptoms of PTSD.

## Activation-synthesis theory

#protoconsciousness

A theory which proposes that dreams reflect brain activation in sleep (Hobson & McCarley, 1977; Hobson et al., 2000). It states that dreams don't have any universal meaning, and are just the brain's attempt to make sense of random and internally generated neural signals during [[Sleep#Stage 5 - REM sleep|REM sleep]].

Neurotransmitters are emitted continuously throughout the day and night. [[Sleep#Stage 5 - REM sleep|REM sleep]] is turned on by surges of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]], as [[serotonin]] and [[Norepinephrine (noradrenaline)|norepinephrine]]. Acetylcholine activates nerve cells in the [[Brain stem#Pons|pons]], and the decrease in serotonin and norepinephrine decreases reflective thought, reasoning, attention, and memory. The activated pons sends incomplete signals to the [[Limbic system#Thalamus|thalamus]], relaying it to the language and visual areas of the [[Cerebrum or Forebrain|forebrain]]. This is the activation part of the theory.

Following this process, the forebrain tries its best to make sense of the signals and put it together into a story. That's the synthesis part of the theory.

The [[Limbic system#Amygdala|amygdala]] is also very active, painting the emotional colors of dreams.

Hobson (2009) proposes that dreams reflect **protoconsciousness**, a primitive or primary state of brain organization that starts to develop before birth and is a building block of consciousness. With the brain free to generate a model of the world, it can assist the person in making better predictions in everyday life, exploring new hypotheses of what could be experienced. This is possible due to the suspension of critical judgement, self-reflection, and memory.

## The forebrain's role

There's an alternative theory to [[#Activation-synthesis theory|activation-synthesis theory]] which emphasizes the role of the [[Cerebrum or Forebrain|forebrain]]. Analyzing data from brain damage patients, Mark Solms (1997) determined that damage to the [[Cerebral cortex#Parietal lobe|parietal lobes]] and to the deep frontal white matter can lead to a complete loss of dreaming. Since damage to the forebrain can eliminate dreaming, even when the [[Brain stem|brain stem]] is working properly, this finding seems to refute the fact that the brain stem is central in dreaming, and highlights the forebrain.

According to Solms, dreams are driven by the motivational and emotional control centers of the forebrain.

## Neurocognitive perspectives

The neurocognitive theory of dreaming argues that explaining dreams only by random activations doesn't tell the full story. Instead, it proposes dreams are reflections of waking life and a meaningful product of a person's cognitive capacities. Children tend to remember a lot less dreams, and their dreams are much simpler.

According to this theory, dreams are cognitive achievements that follow the development of visual imagination and other advanced cognitive abilities (Domhoff, 2001). 

The **dream continuity hypothesis** claims that dreams mirror life circumstances. However, this theory is challenged by the fact that people with disabilities from birth dream the same as people without disabilities, where dreams represent a different life.

## Dream definitions

There are many disagreements around the role of dreams, but scientists generally agree on two things:

1. Acetylcholine turns on [[Sleep#Stage 5 - REM sleep|REM sleep]];
2. The [[Cerebrum or Forebrain|forebrain]] plays an important role in dreams.
