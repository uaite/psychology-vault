Recurring sleep problems can be very serious and impair health and the ability to function well.

## Insomnia

The most common sleep disturbance. It can take three forms:

1. Trouble falling asleep (regularly more than 30 minutes);
2. Waking too early;
3. Waking up during the night and having trouble falling back sleep.

Insomnia severely affects an estimated 9 to 15 percent of people (Morin & Edinger, 2009).

Insomnia is associated with 46% higher healthcare costs compared to patients without a diagnosis (Anderson et al., 2014). However, insomnia is often accompanied by other disorders, like depression, chronic pain, or other medical conditions, which can be the actual cause of cost increase.

Brief issues with insomnia can arise from stress, medications, illness, working late or variable shifts, jet lag, drinking caffeine, or napping during the day. It can become recurrent if there's anxiety around going to sleep.

Sleeping pills can be effective against insomnia, but brief psychotherapy is more effective, and both approaches can be combined. Sleep medication like Ambien and Lunesta can cause odd and dangerous behaviors, and amnesia. They can also cause dependency.

## Narcolepsy

A disorder where people have sudden sleep bouts that can last from a few seconds to many minutes or an hour. The urge to sleep can be overwhelming and happens in all kinds of situations.

Nearly 20% of narcoleptics suffer from depression or social anxiety disorder.

Strong emotions can also trigger **cataplexy** in some people, defined as a complete loss of muscle tone, becoming limp as a rag doll. This is a normal condition during REM sleep, but in narcolepsy, people experiencing it remain alert and can't move.

People with narcolepsy also plummet into REM sleep immediately, suggesting that it stems from a bad sleep-week cycle.

Narcolepsy has increased risk from genetic abnormalities, and can also be developed after a brain tumor or brain damage from an accident. It's also connected to the hormone **orexin**, of which narcoleptics have abnormally few brain cells producing it.

## Sleep apnea

A disorder where airways are blocked during sleep, resulting in bad sleep quality and daytime fatigue. Affects from 2 to 20% of the population, depending on how broadly or narrowly it's defined.

People with sleep apnea snore, loudly gasp, and sometimes stop breathing for more than 20 seconds due to the airway blockage. This struggling to breathe interferes with sleep and causes many interruptions. However, most people with sleep apnea aren't aware of this while sleeping.

A lack of oxygen can lead to many problems, like night sweats, weight gain, fatigue, hearing loss, irregular heartbeat, and increase risk for dementia and other cognitive impairments.

Sleep apnea is often associated with being overweight, so it's a first line of treatment. A CIPAP machine, a face mask that blows air into the nasal passages forcing it to remain open, is also beneficial, but can be challenging to adjust to.

## Night terrors

Typically harmless events that happen almost exclusively to children. They can cause the person to scream, cry, sweat, and thrash around before falling back into deep sleep. This only lasts for a few minutes and the child has no recollection of it.

Occasionally, adults going through intense stress can experience night terrors.

Night terrors aren't associated with vivid dreaming, and they happen almost always in non-REM sleep.

## Sleepwalking

Defined as walking while fully asleep. A sleepwalking person often acts like a fully awake person, although clumsier. Around 15 to 30 percent of children and 4 to 5 percent of adults sleepwalk occasionally. This often involves little activity and is mostly harmless. 

**Sexsomnia** or **sleep sex** refers to people who engage in sexual acts while asleep and don't remember what happened after waking up. 

Sleepwalking almost always happens in non-REM sleep, mostly stages 3 and 4.
