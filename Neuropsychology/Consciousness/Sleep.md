Sleep is central to health and daily functioning, but psychologists still don't have a clear reason for why sleep exists. 

Some theories suggest it plays a critical role in learning, storing memories, and remembering emotional information (Gómez & Edgin, 2015; Payne & Kensinger, 2010). Others suggest it's critical for the immune system. Yet others relate it to insight and problem solving (Wagner et al., 2004), as well as neural development and neural connectivity in general terms (Bushey et al., 2001; Frank & Cantera, 2014; Mignot, 2008). Brain activation during sleep is essential to waking consciousness and to plan, reason, and function as best as possible (Hobson, 2009). Also, some evolutionary theorists proposed that sleep contributes to survival by preserving energy and restoring strength (Siegel, 2005).

There may be considerable truth to several or all of these explanations.

## Quantity of sleep

People need around 7 to 10 hours of sleep every night to function properly. Newborns go up to 16 hours.

Around 1% of the population has a mutation in the DEC2 gene which allows them to sleep 6 hours or less every night without crashing.

A common misconception is that the elderly need less sleep, only around 6 hours a night. In reality, they probably need just as much sleep, but their sleep quality is better.

## Sleep deprivation and debt

After a few nights of sleep deprivation, humans start to feel the effects more. People who are deprived of multiple nights or who consistently get bad sleep often experience depression; difficulties in learning, paying attention, problem solving, thinking clearly, and making decisions; increased emotional reactivity; and slowed reaction times. After more than four days of sleep deprivation, people can experience auditory and visual hallucinations.

Sleep debt can take several nights to "pay off".

Sleep deprivation is also associated with several health issues, like weight gain; increased risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems; and worse immune responses.

## Stages of sleep

The slumbering brain isn't off, it's actually buzzing with activity. The nature and the amount of brain activity varies depending on the **stage** of sleep.

There are 5 stages of sleep. They are cyclical and people pass repeatedly through all stages every night. Each full cycle lasts about 90 minutes. To feel rested, people need to experience deep sleep throughout the night.

As a baseline, the alert brain produces **beta** waves 13 or more times per second, and the relaxed brain produces **alpha waves** 8 to 12 times per second.
### Stage 1

The lightest stage of sleep. Lasts for about 5 to 10 minutes. 

Brain activity powers down by 50% or more, producing **theta** waves four to seven times per second. 

As people deepen their sleep, they become more relaxed and may experience [[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic imagery]], which are scrambled, dreamlike images that flit in and out of consciousness. They may also experience **myoclonic jerks**, sudden limb movements.

In this state of sleep, people are typically confused.
### Stage 2

Accounts for about 65% of sleep.

Brain waves slow down more. However, there are sudden spikes of electrical activity of about 12 to 14 cycles per second called **K-complexes**. They only show up when sleeping.

As the brain activity decreases, so does body temperature, muscles relax, and eye movements stop. 

### Stages 3 and 4

After about 10 to 30 minutes, sleep becomes much deeper. The brain starts emitting **delta** waves, which are as slow as 1 to 2 cycles per second. Drinking alcohol suppressed delta waves, which negatively impacts deep sleep quality.

Stages 3 and 4 have been thought of as a single stage marked by a slow wave, deep sleep.

### Stage 5 - REM sleep

Accounts for about 20 to 25 percent of sleep during a night. REM stands for **rapid-eye movement**.

After 15 to 30 minutes, sleep returns to stage 2 before the brain shifts into very high gear, with high frequency and low-amplitude waves resembling the waking state. This is characteristic of stage 5. REM episodes towards the later part of sleep typically last longer.

The faster brain is also accompanied by increased heart rate and blood pressure, and rapid and irregular breathing. It's also where most vivid dreams occur. However, the body is relaxed and technically paralyzed.

REM sleep is probably essential. Depriving rats of it typically leads to death within a few weeks, although they die sooner from total sleep deprivation. When humans are deprived of REM sleep, they can experience **REM rebound**, which is an increased amount and intensity of REM sleep.
