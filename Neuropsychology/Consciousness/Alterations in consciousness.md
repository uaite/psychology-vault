# Alterations in Consciousness

As [[Sleep|sleep]] demonstrates, consciousness is more complicated than "conscious" and "unconscious". There are other variations in consciousness too.

## Hallucinations

Experiencing what isn't there. This can occur with any sense. Brain scans show that the brain's visual areas becomes active during visual hallucinations just like when seeing a real object (Allen et al., 2008; Bentall, 2014). The same holds true for other senses.

Hallucinations don't happen only with psychologically disturbed people. People can hallucinate during a normal day. In some non-Western cultures, hallucinations are seen as gifts of wisdom from deities.

Visual hallucinations can also happen through oxygen and sensory deprivation, epilepsy, fever, dementia, and migraines. Auditory hallucinations can happen when patients mistake their inner speech to an external source. These types of hallucinations are similar for well-functioning and psychotic individuals, but the latter experiences more negative and less controllable voices (Daalman et al., 2010).

Teaching patients skills to better notice and cope with disturbing hallucinations, viewing them as passing thoughts, has shown promise as psychological treatment (Khoury et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2014).

## Out-of-body experiences

A sense of the consciousness leaving the body.

OBEs are common, with 25% of college students and 10% of the general population reporting having experienced at least one. In many cases, people describe themselves "floating above their bodies". They can also happen as a result of medication, psychedelic drugs, migraines, seizures, or extremely relaxed or stressed states.

People prone to OBEs also report other unusual experiences, like vivid fantasies, lucid dreams, hallucinations, perpetual distortions, and strange body sensations.

Research suggests that when the senses of touch and vision are scrambled, the result is a similar experience to OBEs. The drug ketamine also induces feelings of detachment and dissolves the sense of self by reducing neurotransmission of glutamate, resulting in OBEs as well.

### Near-death experiences

OBEs can also occur during near-death experiences, an experience reported by people who nearly died or thought they were about to. About 25% of patients with NDEs report experiencing their consciousness outside of their body.

NDEs differ across people and cultures, and are constructed from prevalent beliefs about the afterlife.

Science explains NDEs based on chemistry changes in the dying brain, which is bursting with endorphins. There's a high presence of gamma waves and a cascade of neurotransmitters.

## Mystical experiences

Encompasses feelings of oneness with the world, often strongly spiritual. They can last for a few moments, but leave lifelong impressions.

These experiences often involve a sense of unity; transcendence of time and space; a loss of sense of self; and feelings of joy, wonder, and awe. They've been reported in association with prayer, fasting, meditation, and social isolation throughout the ages.

They are unpredictable, so they're also difficult to study. Nevertheless, studies show distinctive patterns of brain activation during relived mystical experiences, with at least 12 areas of the brain associated with emotion, perception, and cognition.

Studies with psilocybin also have 58% of participants reporting mystical experiences, which they claimed was one of the most meaningful experiences of their life. Some participants reported increases in life satisfaction. These reports were lower in patients who ingested a placebo.

Still, there were also 31% of subjects in another study which reported negative short-term reactions, including extreme fear and paranoia. These negative effects didn't persist, but they raise concerns about possible long-term and unpredictable reactions.

Recent research offers glimpses of studying mystical experiences in the lab. It's important to remember they can induce positive and negative emotions.

## Hypnosis

A set of techniques for suggesting alterations in people's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

To increase suggestibility, hypnotists use an **induction method**. This typically includes suggestions for relaxation, calmness, and well-being, plus instructions to imagine pleasant experiences.

Hypnoses was largely regarded as pseudoscientific, but has moved into the mainstream of science and clinical practice. Scientists have established this suggestibility scale:

- 15 to 20 percent pass 0-3/12 suggestions (low suggestibility);
- 15 to 20 percent pass 9-12/12 suggestions (high suggestibility);
- 60 to 70 percent pass 5-8 suggestions (medium suggestibility).

There are several clinical applications. Studies show it enhances CBT practice. It's also useful for treating pain, medical conditions, anxiety, and habit disorders (Lynn, Rhue, & Kirsch, 2010).

The reason why these benefits happen is unclear and may be attributed to general relaxation or enhanced expectancy for improvement. There's no evidence that hypnosis is an effective treatment **by itself**, so hypnotherapy warrants skepticism.

## Misconceptions

**Hypnosis produces an overpowering trance state**

In actuality, hypnosis doesn't have a great impact in suggestibility, and may increase only 1 or 2 suggestions post-hypnosis. People can also resist and oppose hypnotic suggestions at will.

**Hypnotic phenomena are unique**

There aren't any physiological states or markers of hypnosis. People can experience many hypnotic phenomena, like hallucinations or pain insensitivity, from suggestions alone.

**Hypnosis is a sleeplike state**

The hypnotized brain doesn't show similar brain waves to sleep. Furthermore, people are just as responsive to hypnotic suggestions while exercising as they are relaxing.

**Hypnotized people are unaware of their surroundings**

Just untrue. People can even recall details of overheard conversations.

**Hypnotized people forget what happened during hypnosis**

This is called spontaneous amnesia, and is very rare. Mostly happens to people who expect to be amnesic after hypnosis.

**Hypnosis enhances memory**

Scientific studies show this is not true. It does increase the amount of recalled information, but a lot of it is inaccurate. It also tends to increase the person's confidence in the information, despite how accurate it is. US courts have banned the testimony of hypnotized witnesses due to this fact.

## Theories

There are two main models for explaining hypnosis.

### Sociocognitive theory

Attempts to explain hypnosis based on people's attitudes, beliefs, expectations, and responsiveness to waking suggestions.

Studies show people's expectations have a great impact:

> Studies in which participants’ responses vary as a function of what they’re told about hypnosis provide more convincing evidence of causality. For example, participants told that hypnotized people can resist suggestions find themselves able to resist, whereas those told that hypnotized people can’t resist suggestions often fail to resist (Lynn et al., 1984; Spanos, Cobb, & Gorassini, 1985).

Other findings show that suggestibility is trainable, which challenges the view that it's a stable trait, offering support for sociocognitive theory.

### Dissociation theory

#dissociation

Attempts to explain hypnosis based on a separation between normally well-integrated personality functions.

Dissociation is defined as a division of consciousness, where attention, effort, and planning are carried out without awareness.

Hilgard (1977) showed induced "deafness" on a participant based on whether he was touching their arm. This based the metaphor of the **hidden observer** to describe the dissociated, unhypnotized part of the mind that was accessible on cue.

Later research suggests an alternative explanation, saying the hidden observer arises from suggestion, and it's strongly supported. This is no different from the impact of expectation on general hypnosis.

A later revision of this theory poses that hypnosis bypasses the ordinary sense of control people exert over their behavior. As such, suggestions bring out responses with little or no sense of effort or conscious control. This describes well what people experience and fits nicely with sociocognitive theories that emphasize the automatic nature of many behaviors.
