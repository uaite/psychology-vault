Chemical messengers released at the end of an [[Action potential]]. Over 100 neurotransmitters have been identified (Hajjawi, 2014).

Different neurotransmitters send different messages. Some excite the nervous system,  increasing its activity, and others inhibit the nervous system, decreasing its activity. Ultimately, excitatory neurotransmitters increase the likelihood of triggering an [[Action potential|action potential]], while inhibitory ones decrease it. They can play a part in movement, pain, thinking, and emotion. 

Drugs that interact with neurotransmitter systems are called [[Psychoactive drugs|psychoactive]].
